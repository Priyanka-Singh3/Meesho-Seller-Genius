## üè∑Ô∏è Hashtag Handling

- **All hashtags you add in the product description or caption input will always appear in the post preview, regardless of the selected language.**
- When you translate or refine content using AI, only the main text is translated or rewritten‚Äîyour hashtags remain as you entered them.
- You can add, edit, or remove hashtags at any time, and the preview will update instantly to reflect your changes.
- This ensures sellers have full control over their tags for better reach and discoverability on social media.

**Example:**  
If you enter:  
`Dazzle in style with our new saree! #Fashion #Saree #NewArrival #EthnicWear`  
and translate to Hindi, the preview will show:  
`(Hindi translation of main text) #Fashion #Saree #NewArrival #EthnicWear`

## ü§ñ AI Model Integration

- This project uses [Groq](https://groq.com/) to access the Llama-3 model for all AI features.
- You need a valid `GROQ_API_KEY` to use the AI endpoints.
- All AI requests are made via the backend, so your key is never exposed to the frontend.
